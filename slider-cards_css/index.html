                            <p>Their current imperator is Malice Swordshadow. The Ash Legion troops in Ascalon are under command of Tribunes Makk the Silent and Torga Desertgrave, the latter being this legion's final authority in the territory due to seniority.</p>

                            <p>The Flame Legion (pejoratively referred to as the Gold Legion by their enemies), is one of the four charr High Legions. From their base in Citadel of Flame, they attempt to impose their will on the rest of charr society.</p>
                            <p>The Flame Legion is defined by zealotry and superstition, and until two centuries ago, had unified the charr more than any other force since the days of the Khan-Ur.</p>

                            <p>Their capital is the Black Citadel, with Smodur the Unflinching as their imperator. Tribune Bhuer Goreblade, head of the Adamant Guard, is directly in charge of all Iron Legion military operations concerning both internal and external security and defense of the Citadel and its surroundings.</p>
